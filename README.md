## Questions (10 Points)

1. Define HTTP and why it's important.
Define HTTP and why it's important: HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, this protocol sets the rules for how data can be sent and revived through connections and servers.
HTTP is important because it standardizes the way we interact with others on the internet, keeping the internet reliable and safe. 

3. Using [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings) Create a diagram of the request and response cycle when a user visits turing.edu. Include clear labels for all components. Put the link to your drawing below. (3 points possible)

4. Describe two parts of every HTTP request.
There are two parts to every HTTP response and request. 
The response happens when the user clicks a link or enters a web address into the address bar. The response queries the web address/link with an HTTP request with a GET request to get web page information. 
Once the web server sends the desired information an HTTP response is made containing the desired data and web page information like the header/status code.  

5. How do you describe the difference between HTML and CSS? use an analogy or an example in your answer.
HTML is like the metal bare frame of a car. It is essential, it dictates everything about the car, but by itself, the frame is not a car. CSS is like adding cushioned seats, interior, body panels, and some aesthetic quality-of-life updates.
JS is adding the electronic system and motor, it is how the car will perform/behave.

7. How can the Chrome dev tools help with writing HTML and CSS?
The Chrome dev tools can help in a lot of ways like networking, toggling off styles, and live editing of HTML / CSS. The networking tab shows you incoming traffic to help debug any network-related issues. The style tab while highlighting sections of HTML code allows you to toggle off and on the CSS styles to get a better understanding of the webpage. You can even edit HTML and CSS live while viewing the page to see what would happen.  

8. How do you open the Chrome dev tools?
You can open the dev tools in a number of ways, my go-to way is to right-click on the web page and navigate to `inspect element`.  Control + shift + I will also bring up Chrome dev tools. 

9. Why is it important to use semantic HTML tags?
Semantic HTML tags are important because it allows you to call the element directly not having to use an abstraction like id or class, but still, allow you the option to do so in case you need to be very specified. 

10. What are the three components of the box model?
The box model contains margins, borders, and padding properties. These properties can be miniplate to alter the style of the content.
